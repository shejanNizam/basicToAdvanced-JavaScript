### Notes for variable

** Javascript is high-level and interpreted language, JIT(Just in Time) Compiled / Dynamic updated content, control multimedia, animate image, Pretty much everything else

1. variable declaretion ( 5 things must know for this )
     * variable is a storage or container where data stored. 
          const age = 22;

2. variable data type ( number, string, boolean, null, undefined, NaN )
     * const age = 22; --> number 
     * const name = "Nizam"; --> string
     * const isTrue = true; --> boolean 
     * const name;

3. naming convention ( snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase ) + some keyword
     * can't be a reserved keyword
     * should be a meaningful
     * can't start with number(1name)
     * can't contain a space or hyphen(-)
     * case sensitive( name != Name )

4. Fundamentals of JS Number
     * for type check of any variable use --> typeof
     * for stringIntNumber("5") to IntNumber(5) use --> parseInt
     * for stringFloatNumber("5.5") to FloatNumber(5.5) use --> parseFloat
     * for 50 / 0 --> Infinity
     * for -50 / 0 --> -Infinity
     * for string to number
          let x = "10";
          let num = Number(x);
     * for isNaN
          const a = isNaN(9); --> false
          const b = isNaN(4 - "hello"); --> true

5. Operators 
     * some operator --> 
        ( + = Addition, - = Subtraction, * = multiply, / = division, 
         % = modulus(Remainder), ++ = plus plus, -- = minus minus )  
     * for addition if any one data type is string type then concatenate      
         conat a = "44"; const b = 5; 
         const a + b = 445;

6. Shorthands
     * const price = 30;

     * price = price + 10;
          * price += 10; 
     * price = price - 10;
          * price -= 10; 
     * price = price * 10;
          * price *= 10; 
     * price = price / 10;
          * price /= 10; 
     * price = price % 10;
          * price %= 10;
